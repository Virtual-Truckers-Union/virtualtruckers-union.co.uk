                                <p>I like the support that VTU gives to VTCs such as truck watch and driver checks. The
                                    members of the VTU also likes to help out other VTC where they can, for example
                                    there was a member from one VTC that is great with making graphics and mad a logo
                                    for another VTC because no one in that VTC had the ability to make a good logo.</p>
